# Sleep_Alert_System
The project aimed to develop a real-time eye state monitoring system using computer vision techniques and deep learning. The system focused on detecting whether a person's eyes were open or closed, with the objective of enhancing safety and awareness in various contexts, such as driver drowsiness detection and fatigue monitoring.
