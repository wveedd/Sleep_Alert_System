# Sleep_Alert_System
The project aimed to develop a real-time eye state monitoring system using computer vision techniques and deep learning. The system focused on detecting whether a person's eyes were open or closed, with the objective of enhancing safety and awareness in various contexts, such as driver drowsiness detection and fatigue monitoring.

the data set for the alert system is taken from the MRL EYE DATASET.
